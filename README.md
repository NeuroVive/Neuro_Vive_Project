[cite_start]NeuroVive is a smart, multi-channel solution using voice analysis, handwriting analysis, and a proprietary smart pen to enable early detection of Parkinson's disease with high accuracy and low cost[cite: 41, 56]. [cite_start]By detecting subtle, pre-motor symptoms, we aim to slow the progression of the disease and protect nerve cells from irreversible damage[cite: 18, 24].

## üéØ About The Project

[cite_start]Currently, when motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear, up to 80% of nerve cells have already been damaged[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Early symptoms, such as subtle changes in voice or handwriting, are difficult for doctors or patients to notice[cite: 22, 23].

NeuroVive addresses this challenge by providing an accessible, AI-driven platform for early screening. [cite_start]Our system is designed for both individual (B2C) and institutional (B2B) use, integrating seamlessly with hospitals, telehealth providers, and insurance companies[cite: 37].

### ‚ú® Core Features

* [cite_start]**Voice Analysis**: A ~30-second voice recording is analyzed for indicators like fluctuation, tone, and stuttering[cite: 241].
* [cite_start]**Handwriting Analysis**: Users draw spirals or write sentences on-screen or with our smart pen to measure speed, pressure, and fluidity[cite: 243].
* [cite_start]**Smart Diagnostic Pen**: A custom-built device that measures pressure, acceleration, speed, and oscillation during writing for highly accurate data collection[cite: 138, 36].
* [cite_start]**Clinical Dashboard & API**: An interface for healthcare professionals to view patient history and integrate our diagnostic tools into their existing electronic health records[cite: 136, 94].
* [cite_start]**Explainable AI**: Our models provide interpretive reports to help physicians understand the diagnostic results, increasing clinical trust[cite: 132, 189].
* [cite_start]**Medical AI Chatbot**: A chatbot that explains results in simple terms and guides patients on the next steps[cite: 141].

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Our platform is built with a modern, scalable technology stack:

* [cite_start]**AI & Signal Processing**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch [cite: 556]
* [cite_start]**Backend**: Go, Python, Java [cite: 576]
* [cite_start]**Mobile App**: Flutter [cite: 159, 588]
* [cite_start]**DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD Pipelines [cite: 593]
* [cite_start]**Embedded Systems (Smart Pen)**: C/C++ for STM32, FreeRTOS [cite: 606]
* [cite_start]**UI/UX Design**: Figma [cite: 601]

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized to house all components of the NeuroVive ecosystem.
